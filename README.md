DSA Dojo Automator

DSA Dojo Automator is a utility built to automate problem tracking for Data Structures & Algorithms practice.
It handles both GitHub repository commits and CSV sheet updates simultaneously, ensuring a smooth workflow.

Features

▸ GitHub Automation : Uses personal access tokens to perform commits and updates.

▸ CSV Sheet Sync : Full CRUD operations on tracking sheets.

▸ Problem Generator : Generates non-repetitive problems from the belt syllabus.

▸ Custom Problems : Add and manage your own problem statements.

Technical Highlights

▸ Designed for automation and consistency in DSA practice.

▸ Eliminates redundant manual operations across GitHub and sheets.

▸ Simple, extensible, and developer-focused.

Why this Project?

Managing problems, commits, and sheet updates was becoming repetitive.
This tool creates a single automated workflow where:

▸ Problems are generated without repetition.

▸ Git commits are handled automatically.

▸ Sheets stay synchronized in real-time.

This ensures practice time goes purely into solving problems, not managing them.
