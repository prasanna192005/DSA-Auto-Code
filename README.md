DSA Dojo Automator
Overview

As a Problem Designer at a startup, I often need to design, manage, and track large sets of DSA problems. Doing this manually — updating GitHub repositories, syncing CSV sheets, and ensuring no problem is repeated — was slowing me down.

To solve this, I built DSA Dojo Automator:
A tool that automates GitHub commits, manages CSV sheets, and ensures non-repetitive problem generation from a structured syllabus, with support for adding custom problems.

Problem it Solves

Manual Git commits after every problem → Automated using git tokens classic


Tracking solved/unsolved problems in sheets → Automated CRUD operations on CSV.

Risk of repeating problems from the syllabus → Smart generator avoids duplication.

Adding unique company-specific problems → Custom problem support built-in.

This makes the workflow scalable, reliable, and efficient for problem curation.


Why I Built This

In my role, I realized the overhead of managing problems was distracting from the actual creative process of designing questions.
This project automates the repetitive parts so I can spend more time:

Thinking about problem quality.

Ensuring coverage of concepts.

Innovating around new question types.

With DSA Dojo Automator, problem designing becomes structured, fast, and error-free.

▸ Git commits are handled automatically.

▸ Sheets stay synchronized in real-time.

This ensures practice time goes purely into solving problems, not managing them.
